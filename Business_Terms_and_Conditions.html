	My Business Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	APPLICABILITY OF BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
<p>
	All confirmed orders imply the client&#39;s full acceptance of these Business Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>
	No special terms will take precedence over these Business Terms and Conditions unless I expressly accept them in writing.</p>
<h3>
	QUOTES AND ORDERS</h3>
<p>
	Before an order for translation can be placed I will issue a free quote based on the documents to be translated or the information provided by you. The quote shall include:</p>
<ul>
	<li style="margin-left: 36pt;">
		the language pair;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 36pt;">
		the amount of text to be translated (words, pages, etc);</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 36pt;">
		the way the translation will be priced;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 36pt;">
		the terms of payment;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 36pt;">
		the date of delivery of the translation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To confirm the order, you must return the quote with the written approval to me or provide a binding purchase order for the translation service. Dates of delivery are binding only once I have received all the documents and if you have confirmed the order.</p>
<p>
	If I don&rsquo;t receive the order confirmation, I reserve the right not to commence work on the project concerned. If the order is not confirmed within 30 days after the quote has been sent to you, the quote shall be considered null and void.</p>
<p>
	If you modify the documents to be translated after the initial quote has been prepared, I reserve the right, after informing you, to charge an additional fee and/or not to adhere to the initially agreed delivery date.</p>
<p>
	Any discounts offered to you are only for the service to which they apply and do not give you the automatic right to these discounts for any other services or any future work.</p>
<p>
	You agree to consider e-mails, copies and computer files as equivalent to the original and valid proof that the order was confirmed.</p>
<h3>
	PAYMENT</h3>
<p>
	Unless otherwise mentioned on the quote or the purchase order, payment in full shall be made no later than 30 days from the date of invoice.</p>
<p>
	Translations shall remain my property until payment has been received in full.</p>
<h3>
	CANCELLATION</h3>
<p>
	If an order for translation services is placed and subsequently cancelled, you shall pay the full sum for the amount of work actually completed. The completed translation shall become available to you.</p>
<h3>
	PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
<p>
	I have a strong commitment to respecting concerns about privacy. My website or myself does not collect or keep any personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily contact me by e-mail or through my other means of communication. I will not sell, rent or hand over any personal or corporate data to any third party.</p>
<p>
	Every document I receive is treated as highly confidential. I shall never use the confidential information for any purpose other than the performance of the translation services; shall keep safe all materials constituting the confidential information, and shall not make copies in addition to those required in the normal conduct of business.</p>
<h3>
	RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY</h3>
<p>
	In accordance with the ProZ.com <a href="http://www.proz.com/professional-guidelines?pg_version=1.0">Professional Guidelines</a> and the Code of Professional Conduct of the Union of Translators of Russia, I shall endeavor to provide a translation that is as faithful as possible to the original and complies with professional standards. I shall do everything possible to take into account the information provided by the client (glossaries, drawings, other reference materials). However if you fail to provide all of the information required to understand the text I shall not be held liable if the translation does not conform to your standards.</p>
<p>
	I shall not be held liable for any inconsistencies, ambiguities or factual errors in the original text. The verification of the coherence of the final text remains your responsibility.</p>
<p>
	If you modify the final translation without notifying me, I am not liable for the amendments made or their consequences.</p>
<p>
	I am not liable for failure to perform my obligations if such failure is as a result of Acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, storm, hurricane or other natural disaster), war, invasion, terrorist activities, government sanctions, lockout or interruption or failure of electricity or Internet service or any other circumstances beyond my control.</p>
<p>
	My liability on any grounds whatsoever shall be limited to the invoiced value of the work.</p>
<h3>
	COMPLAINTS AND REFUNDS</h3>
<p>
	You agree that due to the inherent differences in the source and target languages a perfect translation of a given word or sentence might be impossible.</p>
<p>
	In case you are not satisfied with the translated documents I will do my best to correct these aspects in cooperation with you and deal with&nbsp;any issue for our mutual benefit. If, despite these efforts, a completed translation job doesn&rsquo;t satisfy you, I can arrange a third-party review by an independent translator. If an independent reviewer finds out gross errors and confirms that the translation in question has been done in a non-professional way I will return your payment in full.</p>
<p>
	You can file a complaint within 14 days after the delivery of&nbsp;translated materials. Claims sent after this period will not be taken into consideration.</p>
