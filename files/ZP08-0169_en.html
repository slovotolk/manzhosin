<P>
<B>Base editions</B> provide the core engine, associated
infrastructure, and components necessary for production data
transformation environments. All implementations require one or more base
editions, depending on the enterprise architecture and
location where WebSphere
TX is implemented. Technology adapters for
integrating with other technologies in the enterprise, such as WebSphere
MQ, are included in the base products.
<P><B>Note</B>: Not all adapters are supported on all platforms. For example a subset of adapters is supported on System z and includes WebSphere MQ, file, and FTP. The adapters not included are those with royalty bearing encryption and security protocols, and those delivered in optional packs.<P>The following editions are
available on Windows&reg;, AIX&reg;, Solaris, and HP-UX and Linux&trade; X86
as well as
on the IBM System z
